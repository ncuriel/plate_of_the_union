            <p>Millions of Americans agree that its time for our leaders to start talking about food.Supermarkets, convenience stores and fast-food outlets offer an endless supply of cheap processed junk foods. Meanwhile, fresh fruits and vegetables, and healthy prepared foods, are unaffordable for many Americans—and in many neighborhoods, hard to find.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4 matters-mid">
            <span class="ion-ios-nutrition"></span>
            <p>The consequences are all around us – from climate change to polluted waterways to sub-minimum wage for food workers and their families. For the first time in a century, children born in the 2000s had a lower life expectancy than their parents, thanks to spiking rates of obesity and diet-related diseases, adding billions of dollars each year to our national health care bill.</p>

        <div class="col-md-4">
            <span class="ion-ios-nutrition"></span>
            <p>This public health crisis reflects a broken food system propped up by a set of agricultural subsidies and other government policies, created and maintained by powerful lobbyists. This system relies on the exploitation of workers, damages the environment, and puts a financial squeeze on farmers. It doesn’t have to be this way. The next president can and should lead with a plan to make sure every American has access to healthy, affordable food that is fair to food workers, good for the environment, and improves farmers’ livelihoods. As candidates hit the campaign trail, we want them to prioritize fixing our food system.</p>

            <p>Plate of the Union is a collaborative campaign driven by Food Policy Action Education Fund, the Union of Concerned Scientists, and the HEAL Food Alliance to raise the voice of Americans who care about food and farm issues during this election season. The policies that shape our food system influence our health, our environment, and our economy. Together, we’re calling on the next President to take bold action for a food system that rewards farmers and farming practices that protect our environment, that provides dignity and fair wages to workers, and ensures that all Americans have access to healthy food that they can afford.</p>
